This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
## Read the training data
```{r}
as1_train <- read.csv("D:/course_era/DataScience_specialization/practical machine learning/assignment1/pml-training_01.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# summary(as1_train) 

# summary(as1_train$classe) 

```
## Read the test data and its summary

```{r, echo=FALSE}
as1_test <- read.csv("D:/course_era/DataScience_specialization/practical machine learning/assignment1/pml-testing.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
# summary(as1_test)

```

## Check the number of target classes.

### Plot these values

## PCA principle component analysis to reduce the inputs to the model.



##### removing the time stamp columns to get rid of the dates column for PCA...
##### removed the NA, completely missing value columns for PCA input.
##### selecting only a subset of columns from the original data set as1_train

#####  the below subset command did not work.
###### as1_test.sub2 <- as1_test[, c(user_name, num_window,roll_belt,pitch_belt,yaw_belt,total_accel_belt,kurtosis_roll######_beearm_y,magnet_forearm_z,problem_id)]

###### as1.test.sub2 <- as1_test[, c(1,2)]
###### x.sub2 <- subset(as1_test,  select = c(1,3,4))
```{r}
as1_train <- read.csv("D:/course_era/DataScience_specialization/practical machine learning/assignment1/pml-training_01.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

#### after cleaning the dataset we have around 54 columns from 159 columns.. 
#### the last variable is the target class
ncol(as1_train)
pca_analysis <- prcomp(as1_train[1:54], scale.=TRUE)

#!summary(pca_analysis)

sum((pca_analysis$sdev)^2)

screeplot(pca_analysis, type="lines")

(pca_analysis$sdev)^2

# PCA 1 to 14 can be combined to have 0.81 % of variation in the dataset. but for this study I am taking only PCA1 and PCA 2. Also this is able to capure the five groups A,B,C,D,E
plot(pca_analysis$x[,1],pca_analysis$x[,2])

# Normalizing the data

# Extracting the labels

# Evaluating the model

library(gmodels)

# I have  assigned some fictitious data for the label as there were no lables given for the test set.


CrossTable(x = as1_test_labels, y = as1_test_pred,
prop.chisq=FALSE)
```
### The below are the predicted lables.
as1_test_pred

####  [1] B A A A A E D B A A B A B A E E E B B B
#### Levels: A B C D E


## Inference from the prediction

####there were no labels for 'C' Category, A was predicted as A 100% classified correctly, There were 10% miss classification ####for 'B', C were all miss classified. D was also calssified correctly 100%. E was also calssified correctly 100%.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
